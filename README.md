## Task Description
In this task, participants search for target “T” shapes amongst pseudo-“L” distractors. The distractors were identical to the targets except that the vertical bar does not intersect the horizontal bar at its midpoint. Having distractors that can be very similar to the targets adds difficulty to the task (e.g., Duncan & Humphreys, 1989) without requiring any specific knowledge or training.
